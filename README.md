# Basic and Common Java Programs for Interview Preparation

This repository contains a curated collection of **basic and commonly asked Java programs**, especially useful for freshers and intermediate developers preparing for coding interviews.

The programs are grouped into categories like **Arrays**, **Math-based questions**, and **String manipulations**, which are frequently covered in technical interviews and coding rounds.

## 🔢 Array-Based Questions

These programs cover common array operations and problem-solving logic:

- `Last_occ_x.java` – Find the last occurrence of an element.
- `Merged_sorted_arr.java` – Merge two sorted arrays.
- `Parsing_array_method.java` – Parse array using different methods.
- `copy_arr_reverse_order.java` – Copy array in reverse order.
- `count_no_greater_x.java` – Count numbers greater than a given value.
- `doublet_sum_of_x.java` – Find pair with a sum equal to X.
- `max_element.java` – Find maximum element in an array.
- `min_element.java` – Find minimum element in an array.
- `negative_begin_positive.java` – Move negatives to the beginning and positives to the end.
- `rotate_by_k_step.java` – Rotate array by k steps.
- `rotate_not_with_extraArr.java` – Rotate array without using extra array.
- `second_maximum.java` – Find second largest element.
- `sort_0_1.java` – Sort array with only 0s and 1s.
- `sort_0_1_2.java` – Dutch National Flag problem (sort 0s, 1s, 2s).

## ➗ Math-Based Questions

These programs help build mathematical logic often required in interviews:

- `Armstrong_Number.java` – Check for Armstrong number.
- `Factorial_number.java` – Find factorial of a number.
- `Largest_of_three.java` – Find the largest among three numbers.
- `Leap_year.java` – Check if a year is leap year.
- `Palindrome_number.java` – Check if a number is palindrome.
- `Perfect_number.java` – Check for perfect number.
- `Prime_number.java` – Check for prime number.
- `Reverse_Number.java` – Reverse digits of a number.
- `even_odd.java` – Check if a number is even or odd.
- `fibonicci_upto_N.java` – Print Fibonacci series up to N terms.
