# Basic and Common Java Programs for Interview Preparation

This repository contains a curated collection of **basic and commonly asked Java programs**, especially useful for freshers and intermediate developers preparing for coding interviews.

The programs are grouped into categories like **Arrays**, **Math-based questions**, **Strings**, and **Interview-Level problems**, which are frequently covered in technical interviews and coding rounds.
